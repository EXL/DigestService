# errata:
# - A travis bug causes caches to trample eachother when using the same
#   compiler key (which we don't use anyway). This is worked around for now by
#   replacing the "compilers" with a build name prefixed by the no-op ":"
#   command. See: https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/4393
# - sudo/dist/group are set so as to get Blue Box VMs, necessary for [loopback]
#   IPv6 support
